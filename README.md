# MERN Boilerplate

Setting up your project can be one of the most tedious and time consuming aspects of programming. Errors can pop up left and right and you can often feel like you aren't writing any sort of creative code.

Using this MERN boilerplate skips that whole process. If you don't know, MERN stand for Mongo, Express, React and Node. If you've made an app with this stack before, you'll know that this process can be trickier than it seems... 


### Prerequisites

- yarn 
- node
- Robo 3t or another Mongo managment tool

## Getting Started

Set up is simple. Clone the repository down, navigate to it, then run `yarn start` from the root. Yes, that's it.
